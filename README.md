### Dependencies

The following dependencies are **required** to run HyprCap:

- `wf-recorder`
- `grim`
- `slurp`
- `hyprland`
- `jq`

The following extras are not essential, but required for some features

- `libnotify` + a notification daemon to get notified
<!-- - dmenu or equivalent (to use an interactive menu) -->

### Manual installation

Copy the `hyprcap` script to a folder in your `PATH`:

```bash
git clone https://alonso-herreros/hyprcap.git HyprCap
cp HyprCap/hyprcap /usr/local/bin
```

For user-level installation, you can use:

```bash
git clone https://alonso-herreros/hyprcap.git HyprCap

```

You're free to delete the cloned repository after copying the script.

## Usage

You can get help on how to use HyprCap by executing:

```bash
hyprcap -h
```

The simplest usage of HyprCap is executing it with one of the available modes.

For example, to capture the currently focused window as a screenshot:

```bash
hyprcap shot window:active
```

## Configuration

You can add the various modes as keybindings in your Hyprland config like so:

```ini
# ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf

...

# Screenshot a region
bind = $MOD SHIFT, S,     exec, hyprcap shot region -z -c -n
# Screenshot current window
bind = $MOD SHIFT ALT, S, exec, hyprcap shot window:active -z -c -n

# Toggle recording a region
bind = $MOD SHIFT, R,     exec, hyprcap rec region -c -n
# Toggle recording current window
bind = $MOD SHIFT ALT, R, exec, hyprcap rec window:active -c -n
```

### Save location

You can save the captures by using the `--write` option. The `--out-dir` and
`--filename` options can be used to specify the output directory and filename
